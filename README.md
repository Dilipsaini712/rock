Steps to Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python:
Import random module: This allows the program to randomly select the computer’s choice.

Define the game logic: Write the rules for determining the winner based on the player's and computer's choices.

Get user input: Ask the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors.

Compare choices: Use conditional statements to determine the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw).

How It Works:
Importing random:

The random.choice() function randomly selects from the list choices (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
Game choices:

The player can choose between rock, paper, or scissors by typing their choice.
The computer makes a random selection from the same choices.
Determine the winner:

The function determine_winner() compares the player’s choice and the computer’s choice using the rules of the game.
It returns a message saying whether the player won, lost, or tied the game.
Main loop:

The loop continuously prompts the user to enter a choice.
If the player types quit, the game ends.
If the player enters an invalid choice, it prompts them to try again.
Game Logic:
Tie condition: If both the player and the computer select the same option, the game results in a tie.

Win condition: The player wins if:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Lose condition: In any other case, the computer wins.
